## Steps to Run HTML and CSS Files in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Follow these steps to set up and run your weather forecasting website project using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) installed on your system.
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- (Optional) Basic knowledge of how to fetch weather data using an API (like OpenWeatherMap or others).

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. Visit the official [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Download and install VS Code for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation instructions for your specific platform.

### Step 2: Install the 'Live Server' Extension in VS Code

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions** tab on the left sidebar, or press `Ctrl + Shift + X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + X` (macOS).
3. In the search bar, type `Live Server`.
4. Install the **Live Server** extension by **Ritwick Dey** by clicking the `Install` button.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository (If Applicable)

1. Open a terminal in your system (or use the terminal inside VS Code).
2. Clone this repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecasting-website.git
   ```
3. After cloning, navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd weather-forecasting-website
   ```

### Step 4: Open the Project Folder in VS Code

1. Launch **VS Code**.
2. Click on **File** > **Open Folder** (or `File > Open` for macOS) and select the project folder containing your HTML, CSS, and (optional) JavaScript files.
3. Alternatively, you can open the folder using the terminal by typing:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### Step 5: Open HTML File in VS Code

1. In the **Explorer** panel on the left (you can open it with `Ctrl + Shift + E`), locate the `.html` file for your weather forecasting website (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Click on the file to open it in the editor.

### Step 6: Run the HTML File using Live Server

1. Right-click anywhere inside the opened HTML file.
2. Select **Open with Live Server** from the context menu.
   
   Alternatively, you can click on the **Go Live** button located at the bottom-right corner of VS Code.
   
3. A new browser tab will open, displaying your weather forecasting website. Any changes made to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript will automatically update in the browser while Live Server is running.

### Step 7: Stopping the Live Server

1. To stop Live Server, click on the **Port: 5500** (or similar) button in the bottom-right corner of VS Code, then click **Stop Server**.
2. You can also close the terminal window in VS Code to stop the server.

### Optional: View HTML without Live Server

If you prefer not to use the Live Server extension, you can directly open your HTML file in a browser:

1. Navigate to the folder where your HTML file is saved.
2. Double-click the `.html` file to open it in your default browser.
   
   > Note: Using Live Server is recommended for its automatic reload feature during development.

### Troubleshooting

- If Live Server doesn't automatically open the page:
  - Ensure the **Live Server** extension is correctly installed.
  - Make sure your HTML file is properly saved.
  - Check that your default browser is set up.
  
  Try restarting VS Code or reloading the window with `Ctrl + Shift + P` and selecting **Reload Window**.

This guide will help you set up and run your **Weather Forecasting Website** using VS Code and Live Server efficiently.
